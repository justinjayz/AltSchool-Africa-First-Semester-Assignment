# HTML-CSS-Exercise
# This repository contains webpages that are all linked together using anchor element, creating hyperlinks to another webpage within the same webpage. I created these for the first semester assignment at <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com" target="_blank">AltSchool Africa</a> School of Engineering.
<p>These were made after 3 month of learning HTML, CSS, etc. The two assignment consists of four web pages in total, where each assignment has two webpages each.</p>
<p>For these projects, I created:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first webpage as a biography page, including my student ID and relevant information about me, as well as reasons and goals for joining the program. Adding a fragment identifier so as to scroll to the top.</li>
<li>The second webpage is a replica of Alt School application form with proper relevant semantic HTML tags. </li>
<li>The third webpage is a table about all the courses and schools existing at AltSchool Africa.</li>
<li>And the fourth webpage contains three different media types. Where the picture element has three sources with responsiveness for mobile, tablet and laptop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Link to the webpage coming soon:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Link</a></li>
</ul>
